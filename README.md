# CS120Final

Project Goals:
1. Create working card deck
2. Have player and dealer classes
3. Have a betting system that player can use to bet tokens
4. Make the betting system save so that your tokens actually go up when you win and down when you lose

Instructions:
The objective of blackjack is to be the person closest to 21. You start by betting how many tokens you want to thow in and then you get delt two cards, you then decide wheter to hit (draw another card) or stand (do not draw another card). If you hit and go over 21 you lose and lose the tokens you betted, but if you are under 21 and over the dealers hand then you win and gain double what you bet! If you tie with the dealer it is called a push and everyone recievers their tokens back. Face cards are 10s and Ace's can be either 11 or 1.

Process:
Something that I have learned not only in this project but also all the previous ones is to not overthink simple games. At the beggining of the project I was too ambitious and was trying to make AI blackjack games, but the game itself is simple so why should the program be anyhting more. Somewhere I got stuck was how to determine if someone had one. When saying that it seems like it is a simple task to code in but I was having a real struggle with coding in busting, ties, and wins. Something that I would like to improve would be the UI. At first I wanted to make rectangles with card number on them to simulate the cards in your hand, but I found this to be very difficult. Next time I would probably watch more videos and learn more before I ever start to code. I find myself watching videos and pausing to code then watching more of the video, but it is better to watch the videos all the way through before hand and fully intake what the videos are telling me. For my game design document I feel like I stayed pretty on track. I tried to not overthink things that I was working on and keep evertyhing simple just like in my game design document.
